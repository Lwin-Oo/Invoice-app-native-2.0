1. User Authentication: 
Users should be able to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely. You can use libraries like bcrypt for password hashing and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.


2. Dashboard: 
Upon logging in, users should be greeted with a dashboard showing an overview of their invoices, payments due, etc.


3. Invoice Creation: 
Users should be able to create new invoices. This involves capturing details such as client information, invoice items (description, quantity, rate), taxes, and due dates.


4. Invoice Management: 
Users should be able to view, edit, and delete their invoices. Implement features like filtering invoices by status (paid, pending, overdue), searching, and sorting.


5. Send Invoices: 
Allow users to send invoices directly from the application via email. You might want to integrate with an email service provider or use SMTP for sending emails.


6. Payment Tracking: 
Users should be able to track payments against their invoices. Mark invoices as paid and record payment details (payment method, date, amount).


7. Invoice Templates: 
Provide pre-designed templates for invoices, or allow users to customize their own templates.


8. Invoice PDF Generation: 
Generate PDF versions of invoices for users to download or send to clients. Libraries like pdfkit or wkhtmltopdf can be helpful for this.


9. Reporting and Analytics: 
Offer insights into the user's financial data with reporting features. This could include graphs showing revenue over time, outstanding payments, etc.


10. Settings: 
Allow users to customize settings such as default currency, tax rates, email templates, etc.


11. Notifications: 
Send users reminders for upcoming invoice due dates or payment reminders.


12. Backup and Restore: 
Implement a backup system to prevent data loss. Users should be able to export their data (invoices, payments) and import it back when needed.


13. Multi-language Support: 
If your application is intended for users in different regions, consider adding multi-language support.


14. Security: 
Implement proper security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. Use HTTPS, input validation, and other security best practices.


15. Mobile Compatibility: 
Ensure your application is responsive and works well on mobile devices since users might need to manage invoices on the go.
